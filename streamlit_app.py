             work, and entertain themselves. Among the most affected demographic groups \
             are Generation Z (Gen Z), typically defined as individuals born between the \
             mid-1990s and early 2010s. This generation has grown up surrounded by \
             digital devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, which have \
             become integral to their daily lives. According to a report by Amin et al. \
             (2020), Bangladesh has experienced a rapid increase in internet penetration, \
             with a significant portion of the population accessing the internet via \
             smartphones. This widespread availability of digital devices has led to \
             extensive use among young people, including Gen Z. In recent years, the \
             pervasive use of digital devices among Generation Z (Gen Z) has raised \
             concerns globally. Bangladesh, like many other countries, has witnessed \
             a surge in digital device addiction (DDA) among its young population. \
             This addiction has multifaceted repercussions, ranging from diminished \
             academic performance to compromised mental well-being. Understanding the \
             scope and consequences of DDA among Gen Z in Bangladesh is crucial for \
             devising effective intervention strategies.")

             Traditional mental health interventions may be inaccessible or \

             various factors contributing to cyberloafing behaviour among Generation Z \
             (Gen Z) students and suggests several solutions to address this issue. \
